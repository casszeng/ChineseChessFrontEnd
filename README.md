Using a picture to show the board with qml, calculate the size of a block to put chess picture into the UI by their location. Disable other side clicking and draging. Handle click and drag event to send a chess structure to the backend to find avalible placements. Any other placements will not be avalible for player to put. Will switch side on each placement. Will make a game status check after each placement and will end the game when there is a win or draw.
